    <h2>Modeling plankton dynamics in the open ocean</h2>
    <p>In this project, we aim to add a mechanistic description of marine plankton dynamics to the biosphere component of the Madingley model. Ultimately, we want to utilize the updated Madingley model to address questions relating to planetary boundaries on biodiversity and biogeochemical flows. This project is a collaborative effort between researchers at CMEC (Erik Mousing, Katherine Richardson, Jørgen Bendtsen), UNEP-WCMC (Cambridge, UK) and the Stockholm Resilience center.</p>
	
    <h2>Small scale spatiotemporal structuring of marine phytoplankton diversity</h2>
    <p>This project aims at understanding how relatively small differences in the ocean environment at the local scale lead to a heterogeneous distribution of phytoplankton diversity and what effect this patchy distribution has on the maintenance of diversity at larger spatial scales. We are especially interested in how physical barriers (fronts), working at various spatiotemporal scales in both the horizontal and vertical planes, influence phytoplankton dispersal patterns (Katherine Richardson, Erik Mousing, Jørgen Bendtsen).</p>
